# 30DaysOfPHP

PHP is a popular server-side scripting language used for web development. It was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf and has since evolved into a powerful language capable of creating dynamic and interactive web applications. PHP code is executed on the server and the output is sent to the client's web browser, allowing for the creation of dynamic web pages that can change in response to user input. PHP is open-source and free to use, making it a popular choice for developers of all skill levels. It is also compatible with a wide range of databases, including MySQL, making it easy to create database-driven web applications. Overall, PHP is a versatile language that is widely used in web development and continues to evolve with new updates and features.
